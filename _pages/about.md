I'm a PhD student at University of British Columbia and my supervisor is [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/). 

My research interest is about incorporating implicit contexts into large language models.

Before starting a PhD, I primarily worked with members at [Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL)](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/) and IBM Research while receiving a MS in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.
I also spent some time in industry, I worked for Naver in Knowledge Base team for about a year 
and I worked for IBM as an application developer for a year before starting Master's degree.

[//]: # (I'm particularly interested in understanding and finding new insights from unstructured texts by transforming the text to structured form.)

[//]: # (Ultimately, I would like to develop a simple, robust, and efficient model with an interpretable inference process that can be easily applied to industry.)

[//]: # (My most recent works are focused on relation extraction, geometric embedding, graph neural networks, and knowledge graphs.)
