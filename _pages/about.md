I'm a software engineer working on knowledge base at Naver Corp. 
Previously, I completed my MS in Computer Science at UMass Amherst and completed my Bachelor's at Kwangwoon University. 

I'm particularly interested in graph structured data with graph neural networks or knowledge graphs and understanding raw texts.
Ultimately, I would like to develop a simple yet efficient model that can be easily applied to industry with a decent performance.

My most recent works are focused on relation extraction and question answering using geometric embedding and graph neural networks.
I primarily worked with members at Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL) on geometric embedding and IBM Research on Graph neural networks.

Projects
------
**Joint constrained learning using box embedding**\
 Implemented relation extraction model using box embedding. 
 Effectively reduced violated constraints in relations labels, which is much better than our baseline vector models.

**Virtual node augmented graph neural networks for link prediction**\
 Implemented virtual node model with graph neural networks for link prediction tasks on Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets.
 Our model outperformed not only standard GNN models, such as GCN, SAGE, and GIN, but also recent complex models, such as Position aware-GNN and APPNP.  
 Under review at NeurIPS 2021.

**Question answering on knowledge graph using box embedding**\
  Implemented question answering model by embedding queries as probabilistic boxes using gumbel distribution.
  Our model was more mathematically explainable than Query2Box model and produced similar performance.

**Interdependency between stock market and financial news articles**\
  Analyzed the interdependency between stock market and financial articles using sentiment analysis. 
  Discovered trends that stock prices respond to social issues before the articles do. 
  Published IEEE BigData 2019 workshop
