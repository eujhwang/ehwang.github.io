I'm a software engineer working on knowledge base at Naver Corp. 

I'm particularly interested in understanding and finding new insights from unstructured texts by transforming the text to structured form.
Ultimately, I would like to develop a simple, robust, and efficient model with an interpretable inference process that can be easily applied to industry.

My most recent works are focused on relation extraction, geometric embedding, graph neural networks, and knowledge graphs.
I primarily worked with members at Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL) and IBM Research while receiving a MS in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.

Projects
------
**Joint constrained learning using box embedding**\
 Implemented relation extraction model using box embedding. 
 Effectively reduced constraint violations in relations labels by utilizing box's inherent ability of handling anti-symmetric relations, 
 which indicates the output from the model is more coherent than our baseline vector model.

**Virtual node augmented graph neural networks for link prediction**\
 Proposed virtual node augmented graph neural networks by using single virtual node to multiple virtual nodes for link prediction to capture long-range dependencies in graphs.
 Our model constantly produce better performance on large and dense graphs, such as ddi, collab, and ppa (OGB benchmark datasets).   

**Question answering on knowledge graph using box embedding**\
  Implemented question answering model by embedding queries as probabilistic boxes using gumbel distribution.
  Our model was more mathematically explainable than Query2Box model and produced similar performance.

**Interdependency between stock market and financial news articles**\
  Analyzed the interdependency between stock market and financial articles using sentiment analysis. 
  Discovered trends that stock prices respond to social issues before the articles do.
